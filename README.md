# SmartShift: A Secure and Efficient Approach to Smart Contract Migration

SmartShift is a framework designed to facilitate the secure and efficient migration of smart contracts across blockchain platforms while ensuring data integrity and minimizing operational disruption. By employing intelligent state partitioning and progressive function activation, SmartShift enables seamless contract upgrades with reduced downtime.

## üìå Features
- **Smart Contract Dependency Analysis**: Automatically maps function-data dependencies.
- **Optimized Migration Sequences**: Prioritizes critical functions and data to minimize downtime.
- **State Segmentation & Sharding**: Efficiently partitions contract state for scalable migration.
- **Batch Processing Mechanism**: Ensures structured and gas-optimized transactions.
- **Security-Driven Migration**: Mitigates denial-of-service risks and data corruption issues.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Designed to support smart contract migration across blockchain networks.

## üèó System Architecture
SmartShift comprises the following key components:

1. **AST Generator**: Parses smart contract code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for structured analysis.
2. **Dependency Builder**:
   - **Dependency Matrix Builder**: Maps function-data dependencies.
   - **Priority Vector Calculator**: Determines the optimal migration order based on function importance.
3. **State Processor**:
   - **State Extractor**: Analyzes contract storage structure.
   - **State Shard Generator**: Segments contract state into shards for incremental migration.
4. **Batch Manager**:
   - **Batch Generator**: Groups shards into migration batches while adhering to gas limits.
   - **Batch Processor**: Executes batched transactions to deploy the migrated smart contract efficiently.

## üî¨ Implementation & Evaluation
- **Languages Used**: Python, Go
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses Ethereum-based frameworks such as Infura and Etherscan.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Function Activation Threshold (FAT)**: Measures migration efficiency.
  - **Reduction in Downtime**: SmartShift reduces migration-related delays significantly compared to traditional methods.

## üîê Security Considerations
SmartShift employs a structured migration mechanism to enhance security:
- **Prevents DoS Attacks**: Prioritizes critical functions and dependencies.
- **Ensures Data Integrity**: Verifies and reconstructs migrated states to prevent corruption.
- **Structured Execution**: Optimized transaction processing reduces system-wide disruptions.

## üìÇ Installation & Usage
